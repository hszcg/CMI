The center is led by Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, a world-famous computer scientist and the only Turing Award winner in all of Asia, who has pioneering contributions in theoretical computer science and quantum information. \n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Purpose:</b> Under the leadership of Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, we have established a strong international team for CMI. CMI is committed to the promotion of the progress of computer science and technology in the field of machine intelligence and the enhancement of effective cutting-edge research and education. Our goal is to build up a world-class interdisciplinary research center and to provide innovative higher education in the area of machine intelligence.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Subject description:</b> Machine Intelligence (MI), also known as artificial intelligence (AI), is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. This concept was proposed as early as 1956. Artificial intelligence is the intelligence usually achieved through an ordinary computer and is an important research field of modern computer science which has rapidly influenced human life since its conception. Today's well-known applications in AI include search engines, social networks, and robotics. The involved disciplines are philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, psychology, computer science, cybernetics, determinism and the uncertainty principle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Research Interests:</b> The Center for Machine Intelligence focuses on how to make machines behave like humans, including cognition, reasoning, and action. At present, the field of machine learning involves a wide range of emerging utilities. The information presentation and processing in different applications are not always consistent, however. We are committed to a unified and transferrable data representation forms such as text, image and voice, in order to systematically interoperate contents and methods in different areas. Our medium-term plan is devoted to an interdisciplinary investigation among different applications in human-machine interaction. Our longer-term goal is to combine machine learning with other majors in computer science, such as network science or theoretical computer science. For example, sensor networks can be used to provide many types of massive real-time data streams;  machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze real-time objects in the dynamic and complex real-world, for smart city tasks, for instance. \n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Research areas</b>: Machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), pattern recognition, reinforcement learning, genetic algorithm, artificial neural network, logic programming, intelligent search, knowledge representation, planning, soft computing, artificial life, data mining and fuzzy control.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Research focus:</b> The research areas of the Center for Machine Intelligence are mainly concentrated in the fields of machine learning, machine translation, image recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, computer graphics, speech recognition, data mining, information retrieval and robotics .

However, plenty of the bilingual language resources available on web are aligned only at the document level. To exploit this data, we have to extract the bilingual sentences from these documents. \nThe common method is to break the doc- uments into segments using predefined anchor words, then these segments are aligned.

Several performance measures like Word Error Rate, Position Independent Word Error Rate and the BLEU and NIST scores are widely use and provide a useful tool for comparing different systems and to evaluate improvements within a system. However the interpretation of all of these measures is not at all clear, and the identification of the most prominent source of errors in a given system using these measures alone is not possible. Therefore some analysis of the generated translations is needed in order to identify the main problems and to focus the research efforts. This area is however mostly unexplored and few works have dealt with it until now.

In statisti- cal machine translation, the conventional approach is to seg- ment the Chinese character sequence into words during the pre-processing. The training and translation are performed afterwards. However, this method is not optimal for two rea- sons: 1. The segmentations may be erroneous. 2. For a given character sequence, the best segmentation depends on its context and translation. \nIn order to minimize the translation errors, we take dif- ferent segmentation alternatives instead of a single segmen- tation into account and integrate the segmentation process with the search for the best translation. The segmentation de- cision is only taken during the generation of the translation. With this method we are able to translate Chinese text at the character level.

This is problematic for many nat- ural language processing tasks. The standard approach is to segment the Chinese character sequence into words. Here, we investigate Chi- nese word segmentation for statistical machine translation. We pursue two goals: the first one is the maximization of the final translation qual- ity; the second is the minimization of the man- ual effort for building a translation system. \nThe commonly used method for getting the word boundaries is based on a word segmenta- tion tool and a predefined monolingual dictio- nary. To avoid the dependence of the trans- lation system on an external dictionary, we have developed a system that learns a domain- specific dictionary from the parallel training corpus. This method produces results that are comparable with the predefined dictionary. \nFurther more, our translation system is able to work without word segmentation with only a minor loss in translation quality.", "author": "Jia Xu#http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/JiaXu/, R.

We introduce and study four saliency principles to realize the RCST. This generalizes the previous static image for saliency computational model to video.

I\nwill argue that the core representations that support reasoning can be\nunderstood as a 'probabilistic language of thought', and that\nreasoning is an approximation to probabilistic inference. I will\nillustrate this claim with examples of reasoning about games and\nproperty induction. However, I will suggest that the bridge between\nthe probabilistic language of thought and empirical data is a firm\nunderstanding of natural language. I will sketch a model of natural\nlanguage pragmatics and semantics, and describe experimental evidence from communication games and quantity implicature. I will then describe how we can extend this framework to encompass vague language, focusing on scalar adjectives (like \"tall\").
